INCLINE

With the current pandemic and employment rates crashing down, a student who is about to graduate faces a lot of difficulties in order to find a job. The solution to this problem is to work hard and to be the best at what one does. But without proper guidance, this becomes very difficult to achieve.
In order to do this, we at Incline have come up with a project that lets the student know how likely he/she is to get placed and what role would be offered to the student with an estimated salary package. It also recommends how much a student should work in order to get placed.
It becomes difficult for students to know where they stand when it comes to Placements. In order to solve this, students should know what they have to do to improve themselves. The project INCLINE helps students by letting them know how likely they are going to get placed and will also suggest to them what role they might be given with the estimated salary package, thus letting them know where they stand so they can improve accordingly.

Please read the Project report (INCLINE.pdf) for more details.
